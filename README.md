# Song_Recommendation_System

I have started a project exploring the different types of recommendation systems such as content-based filtering and user-based collaborative filtering techniques. I have completed the content-based filtering song recommendation system using cosine similarity to determine which songs are similar to each other. The next step is to explore datasets with both users and items so that I could build a collaborative filtering recommendation system. Another possibility is to build a recommendation system for natural language processing.
